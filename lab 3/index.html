    <h2>Welcome to My Watch Collection</h2>
    <p>I will admit that I have a love for watches!  I've enjoyed collecting watches since the age of 7.  I am intrigued by the 
        craftsmanship and the intricacy that goes into the creation of a watch.</p>

    <p>My favorite brands of watches are Invicta, Casio (G-Shock), and of course Apple.  Watches are just like money and time...
       you can never have enough.</p>

<p>The thing I love about the Casio G-Shock watch is that it can take a licking and keep on ticking! My job is pretty physical but
   through it all, my G-Shock prevails!  There are a lot of neat functions on it as well!  It's definitely worth the investment!</p>
