    <h1>PS5 Accessories</h1>
    <p>If you haven't heard about the hottest gaming console on the market by now,
        you must be living under a rock!  The PS5 console has been released and I 
        am a proud owner of the console! Buckle your seatbelts for the fantastic voyage inside the world of the PlayStation 5!</p>

        <p> There are also accessories available for the PS5.  The 3D audio of the headset will give you the feeling that you are 
            really inside the game! The camera is also must have for your system.  The gaming controller has a microphone and speaker
            built in.  There is also a remote available for easy navigation.
