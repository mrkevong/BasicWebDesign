    <h1>Welcome to The Extraordinary World of PS5</h1>
    <p>If you haven't heard about the hottest gaming console on the market by now,
        you must be living under a rock!  The PS5 console has been released and I 
        am a proud owner of the console! Buckle your seatbelts for the fantastic voyage inside the world of the PlayStation 5!</p>

        <p>I must tell you that it was a difficult task to get my hands on this console!
            From waiting hours in line in the wee hours of the morning, going to every store in the city and I even had to deal with a few low down scammers! I will say
            that through it all, it was well worth it!  Everyday I'm blown away by the graphics, the sound, and the clarity of each individual detail.
        </p>
